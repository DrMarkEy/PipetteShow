//********** Instructions
//The last line of data shouldn't have a comma at the end.
// Refer to https://volksswitch.org/index.php/volks-devices/fully-customizable-3d-printable-aac-keyguard-for-tablets/non-rectangular-keyguard-perimeters/
// for detailed instructions in using this file.

//********** Column Values
// ID - (for your use only) to easily see which data line corresponds to an opening in the keyguard - numeric only
// x - the x-coordinate of the anchor points of the additions
// y - the y-coordinate of the anchor points of the additions
// width - the width of the addition
// height - the height of the addition
// shape - the shape of the addition: 
//             "r" = rectangle - use height and width, 
//             "rr" = rounded rectangle - use height, width and corner radius, 
//             "c" = circle - use width as the diameter, 
//             "t1"/"t2"/"t3"/"t4" = triangles along case opening edges - use height and width, 
//             "r1"/"r2"/"r3"/"r4" = rectangles along case opening edges - use height and width,
//             "rr1"/"rr2"/"rr3"/"rr4" = rounded-rectangles along case opening edges - use height, width and corner radius,
//             "cm1"/"cm2"/"cm3"/"cm4" = crescent moons along case opening edges - use height and width, 
//             "f1"/"f2"/"f3"/"f4" = fillets - use width as the radius, 
//             "ped1/ped2/ped3/ped4" = a standard clip-on strap pedestals at a specific x,y location
//             "stab1/stab2/stab3/stab4" = a standard slide-in tabs at a specific x,y location

// thickness - this parameter is reserved for future use, leave it at 0 for now
// trim above - removes all of a shape above a certain height in mm relative to the lower-left corner of the case (set to -999 to ignore)
// trim below - removes all of a shape below a certain height in mm relative to the lower-left corner of the case (set to -999 to ignore)
// trim to right - removes all of a shape to the right in mm relative to the lower-left corner of the case (set to -999 to ignore)
// trim to left - removes all of a shape to the left in mm relative to the lower-left corner of the case (set to -999 to ignore)
// corner radius - the radius of each corner of a rounded rectangle
// ... pedestals and slide-in tabs get all but their x,y locations from the customizer settings
